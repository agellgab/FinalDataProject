				<h3>The econonmies with the highest world leaders' salaries over its compatriots</h3>
				<p>The chart below shows you who are the presidents who earn the most if compared to the average national wage of his/her own country in on axis. The president of Azerbaijan earns 31 times more than the national average wage of that country, for example.</p>
				<p>That same chart shows you what is the Gini coefficient of the countries in the other axis. The Gini coefficient is an index that measures the distribution of wealth in a country. The higher it approaches to 1, the higher the inequality in that country. South Africa has one of the highest Gini ratios, for example.</p>
				<p> Scroll around the scatterplot, to see who are the world leaders that go big when it comes to salaries over their own nationals. Can you make any correlations between the distritubion of wealth in a country and the ammount of money world leaders make?</p>
